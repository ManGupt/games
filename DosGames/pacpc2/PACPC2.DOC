1. System Requirements
----------------------

386-33 with local bus video ( minimum )

It is at its best running on a 486-33, or better, with local bus
video ( VESA or PCI ).

1 Meg of extended Memory ( if you want sound )
Sound Blaster Pro, or compatible, soundcard.
Multi-sync monitor for the full screen mode.
                                            
Note: This game won't run on a 286.

Note: You will need 1 Meg of extended memory so make sure you have
      HIMEM.SYS or someother XMS manager loaded in you config.sys.



2. Running the Game
-------------------

At the DOS prompt type

pacpc2
    then hit enter

or if you want to run the full screen mode and your monitor can
take it ( READ SECTION 5 !!)  type

pacpc2 f
   then hit enter



 
3. Game Instructions
--------------------

Eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, eat a flashing power pill then chase and 
eat the ghosts. Also eat any fruit for extra points. That's about 
all there is too it really. 

Eating a '.' is worth 10 points, power pills 50 points. 
Ghosts score 200,400,800,1600 eaten in order.

Extra lives at 10000pts, 30000pts, 50000pts, 80000 pts
then every 30000 after that.

Fruit are worth various points.


4. Controls & Keys
------------------

Arrow keys, or
'A' - Up 
'Z' - Down 
'N' - Left 
'M' - Right

'P' - Pause
'Q' - Sound On/Off


On the title screens, press 

'A' for info about the game,

'J' to calibrate and use a joystick

'C' to turn sound on/off, set full screen mode and to turn of
    the FAST option. There was an upgrade for PacMan that made
    her move about twice as fast as the ghosts, this gives the
    same results. See section 7 for details.


ESC - Quits current game or exits program


5. Soundcard Support
--------------------

This game only supports Soundblaster Pro or better soundcards. It should work
with compatibles but I haven't tested it with many.

To allow sound in the game you need to set the DOS 'BLASTER' variable. 
If you  have a soundblaster Pro, or better, this should already be in your
autoexec.bat.

If you don't set the blaster variable but have a SB-Pro  compatible card, 
eg. Zeos integrated business audio using the ESS chip ( is that an obscure 
soundcard or what?) you need to do the following at the DOS command prompt

set blaster=A220 I5 D1 

Where :
A is the port your card uses, usually port 220.
I is the interrupt the card uses, usually 5 but it could be 7.
D is the DMA channel to use, usually 1 could be 3.

The hardware addresses MUST match the settings of the card, or you
will not get sound.

There are immediate plans to support any other soundcards or the PC's 
internal buzzer. However I like the look of these new Interwave based
cards so I might get one of those and support it in the future.



6. Video Mode Support
---------------------

This is really important !! 

PacPC supports a full screen mode, this uses a vertical resolution of 288 
pixels and horizontal resolution of 224 pixels, just like the old arcade 
machine ! This mode only really works on 'newer' multi-sync monitors 
( eg. CTX 1765/1545 ). 

By default PacPC runs in a compatible mode, 320x200 pixels and the screen 
scrolls up and down. To run in its full glory run with the command line 
option F  ie.  PACPC2 F

If your screen blanks or the picture goes crazy it probably means that your 
monitor can't run the full screen mode, so just hit escape and run with the 
compatible mode.

Also you can configure the video mode from the 'Config' screen within PacPc. 
Just hit 'C' on one of the title screens and look for the Video Mode
options.
        

7. Config Screen Options
------------------------------

From the main title pressing 'C' takes you to the 'Config' screen
here you can make Pac move double her speed, turn audio on/off and
Change the video mode.

Fast Pac
'F' turns on/off the fast pac mode, here you move much faster
than the ghosts.

Number of Lives:
'N' will change number of lives you can play with from 1 to 5.

Begin Level:
'B' changes the beginning level from 1 to 30. The game plays
pretty much the same after level 21 with mazes 3 & 4 repeating
with different colours. So you don't need to go higher than 29.
Carry on pressing 'B' as after level 30 is goes back to 1.

Joystick sensitivity:
'T' changes the joystick sensitivity. This affects how the program
detects movement of the joystick. Lower values mean smaller movements
of the joystick detect a movement, higher values means the joystick
is less sensitive.


 
8. About the Game & Author
--------------------------

Welcome to release 2.00 of PacPc, after a lot of modifications from the
first release

I used the same basic 'engine' I wrote for MsPacPc and modified that to
behave like the original arcade game, and well it's pretty close unless
you really want to look for differences.

Again it's all coded in C along with assembler routines for sound, sprites,
screen updates etc.

Please don't mail me asking for the source code as I will not be releasing
any of it.

This game is FREEWARE, you don't have to register/pay/contribute or whatever,
it's free !! Now who said "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch...". 
This game is 'as is' and comes with no warranty either specific or implied, 
you are quite free to distribute it, copy it or eat it, whatever you want to 
do. You should not, however, charge for it. Selling this game for profit, 
rather than a valid duplication fee, will result in really bad Karma, and
depending on your religious persuasion may result in eternal damnation,
or at least a couple of centuries in purgatory.

Since the last releases I've moved e-mail address, and the games should have
a new permanent web page.

If you have any comments you can reach me via internet e-mail at
        jrokweb@san.rr.com


9. Thanks
---------

Thanks must go to all those who've I've discussed the game with and 
have done any sort of testing with it. These include, Kim Voegele,
Lee Tonks, Marshall Stowe Sloane, Si Owen, Nadeem Ahktar, Kev
Cheung, Dave Hallock plus anyone else I've forgotten (sorry!).
BTW the cheat code is to type eggs <and press enter> during
game play, f1,f2 & f3 do cheat things.
