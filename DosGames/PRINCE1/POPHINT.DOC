Ok.. for all you guys that end up at level ten with 13 seconds left (I know it
bugs the hell outa you) all you have to do to get more time is load the
prince.sav file up into a hex editor like pc-tools or something then you get

0000: 0b 00 b6 01 03 00 03 00
      ^           ^     ^
       TIME            Health (In numbers) eg.. 12 = 12 health
      (In Min)   Level (Remeber to put this in hex)
