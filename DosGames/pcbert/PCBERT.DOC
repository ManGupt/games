1. System Requirements
----------------------

386-33 with local bus video ( minimum )

It is at its best running on a 486-33, or better, with local bus
video ( VESA or PCI ).

1 Meg of extended Memory ( if you want sound )
Sound Blaster Pro, or compatible, soundcard.
Multi-sync monitor for the full screen mode.
                                            
Note: This game won't run on a 286.

Note: You will need 1 Meg of extended memory so make sure you have
      HIMEM.SYS or someother XMS manager loaded in you config.sys.



2. Running the Game

    then hit enter




 
3. Game Instructions
--------------------


4. Controls & Keys
------------------

Default Keys

A - up left
Z - down left
' - up right
/ - down right

ESC - ends game/exit game from title screen



5. Soundcard Support
--------------------

This game only supports Soundblaster Pro or better soundcards. It should work
with compatibles but I haven't tested it with many.

To allow sound in the game you need to set the DOS 'BLASTER' variable. 
If you  have a soundblaster Pro, or better, this should already be in your
autoexec.bat.

If you don't set the blaster variable but have a SB-Pro  compatible card
you need to do the following at the DOS command prompt

set blaster=A220 I5 D1 

Where :
A is the port your card uses, usually port 220.
I is the interrupt the card uses, usually 5 but it could be 7.
D is the DMA channel to use, usually 1 could be 3.

The hardware addresses MUST match the settings of the card, or you
will not get sound.

There are immediate plans to support any other soundcards or the PC's 
internal buzzer.



6. Video Mode Support
---------------------

This is really important !!

PC*Bert uses a 'cooked' video mode of 256 x 256 pixels, 


 
7. About the Game & Author
--------------------------

Finally after a million delays, and just about every other project
I've been working on taking priority, this is the first release version
of PC*Bert.

PC*Bert was started in late 1995, and sat around untouched for very
long periods of time. Most recently my arcade simulation project took
priority and it was left to sit for another month or so..

Still, here it is hopefully bug free and ready to roll..

Again it's all coded in C along with assembler routines for sound, sprites,
screen updates etc.

Please don't mail me asking for the source code as I will not be releasing
any of it.

This game is FREEWARE, you don't have to register/pay/contribute or whatever,
it's free !! Now who said "There ain't no such thing as a free lunch...". 
This game is 'as is' and comes with no warranty either specific or implied, 
you are quite free to distribute it, copy it or eat it, whatever you want to 
do. You should not, however, charge for it. Selling this game for profit, 
rather than a valid duplication fee, will result in really bad Karma, and
depending on your religious persuasion may result in eternal damnation,
or at least a couple of centuries in purgatory.

Thanks must go to everyone who's Beta tested, added input and
been involved in anyway.
